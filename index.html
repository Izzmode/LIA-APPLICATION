        <p id="subtitle">A NEW FRONT-END DEVELOPER</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          A future front-end developer, seeking to embark on a journey of
          learning and growth. From the realm of coding and technology, I come
          forth seeking an internship, a place where I may hone my skills and
          help bring new and innovative ideas to life.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am available from November to April, a time of great change and new
          beginnings. During this time, I am eager to delve into the mysteries
          of the front-end, to master the art of web development and to create
          stunning interfaces that are both functional and aesthetically
          pleasing.
        </p>
        <p>
          With my background in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I am equipped to
          handle any challenge that comes my way. I am driven by my passion for
          technology and a desire to constantly improve, always seeking to push
          the boundaries of what is possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am confident that with your guidance and expertise, I can become a
          valuable member of your team and help create something truly epic.
          Whether it be a dynamic website, an interactive application, or a
          groundbreaking user experience, together we can unleash the full
          potential of the front-end.
        </p>
        <p>
          So I ask of you, esteemed mentors of the front-end development world,
          to grant me this opportunity to serve and learn at your side. I am
          ready and eager to take on this adventure, to bring my skills and
          dedication to your team and help bring new and innovative ideas to
          life.
